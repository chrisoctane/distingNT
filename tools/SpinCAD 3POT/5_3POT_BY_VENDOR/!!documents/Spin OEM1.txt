This set of effects encompasses a wide range of professional applications.

The program set is designed for a mono input from a single effects send, with stereo outputs, for portable mixer applications.

The PA vocal program is especially tailored to provide a flat frequency response, so that in live applications, potential feedback is reduced. Other programs, such as the halls, the plate and the gated program have complicated frequency responses that are excellent in recordings or for use with strong signal sources, such as mic'd snare drums. Of course these other programs can 
be used with live vocals, but if feedback becomes a problem, this PA Vocal 
program should be selected instead.
