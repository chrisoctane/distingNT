Updates
=======

It's always best to get updates from their official sites but I'll try to keep these versions updated for simplicity. If you want the latest and greatest, see:

=======

If updating feels a bit daunting, ignore HEX files, download and install the MCUXpresso Tool for your operating system.  Once it opens, you'll see two open windows: at the bottom-right of the front window you'll see, in blue text: "Import Manufacturing Package". - that's your distingNT_X.X.zip file. click the text.

once you've imported the zip file, you'll get scary warnings and red bars. click on autodetect to make it find your NT then click start. 

Reboot Disting once completed.
