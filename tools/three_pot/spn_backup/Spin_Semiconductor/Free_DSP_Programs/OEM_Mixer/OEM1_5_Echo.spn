;OEM1_5 Echo

;pot0 = Repeat feedback
;pot1 = Delay time
;pot2 = Repeat damping

;The echo program allows a mono input to produce a mono output,
;delayed and repeated.

;The rather long delay can be used for dramatic performance effects,
;but at shorter delay settings, karaoke-style reverb is obtained.

;The delay is variable from 50 to 700mS (Fs=46KHz) 
;and depends on crystal frequency

;read inputs, add to feedback and write to delay:

rdax	fbk,1		;read feedback value
mulx	pot0		;scale by pot0 value for feedback control
rdax	adcl,0.5	;read and add inputs	
rdax	adcr,0.5
wra	delay,0		;write result to delay

;prepare read pointer based on pot1 setting:

rdax	pot1,1		;read pot value
sof	0.93,0.07	;limit delay range
rdfx	pfil1,0.001	;filter pot value
wrax	pfil1,1		;write filter register, keep in ACC
rdfx	pfil2,0.001
wrax	pfil2,1
wrax	addr_ptr,0	;load address pointer with first read position
rmpa	1		;read memory from pointer position
wrax	dout1,0		;store first value, clear ACC

;now get second  value:

or	%00000000_00000001_00000000	
rdax	pfil2,1		;get pointer back and add
wrax	addr_ptr,0	;load pointer again
rmpa	1
wrax	dout2,0		;store second value, clear accumulator

;now get an interpolation value:

rdax	pfil2,1
and	%00000000_00000000_11111111

;now crossfade between delay read values using interp value:

rdax	dout2,1
rdax	dout1,-1
mulx	interp		;crossfade with interp
rdax	dout1,1

;now take this as the output, filter and arrange feedback:

wrax	dacl,1		;write result to both outputs, full scale
wrax	dacr,1		;keep in ACC
wrax	temp,1		;store in temp
rdfx	lpf,0.1		;filter signal
wrlx	lpf,-1		;acc is filtered
rdax	temp,-1		;negative filter input value
mulx	pot2		;crossfade around filter eith pot2
rdax	temp,1		;filter in again, in phase
wrax	fbk,0		;write to feedback register
