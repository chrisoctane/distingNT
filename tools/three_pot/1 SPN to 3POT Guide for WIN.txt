● You've made a fancy effect with SpinCAD or found some .spn files to use in the Disting's three_pot algorithm. 

First, make a text file with the same name as the effect. eg:

my_lovely_reverb.spn
my_lovely_reverb.txt

Any spaces in the filename or dodgy characters will cause conversion to fail with a parsing error. 

The text file is what the Disting uses to display info on-screen. See 'spn textfile format.txt' for proper formatting.  



● WSL: Windows Subsystem for Linux
To use the makefile commands that convert .spn files to .3pot on Wndows 11, you'll need WSL and some tools.


● Right-click the desktop and select, ‘Open in Terminal’. Type:

wsl --install


● After that, a new terminal window will have Ubuntu in the dropdown menu or you can find Ubuntu in your start menu.
Select Ubuntu, complete
user/password, then type:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential


● That’s the VM and requisite tools installed. Now the commands for makefile in Ubuntu:

cd ../..
cd mnt/c/Users/*USER*/Documents/GitHub/distingNT/tools/three_pot

(*USER*: This should be your user account folder name)


● Drop *.spn and their corresponding *.txt files in the ‘spn’ folder, then in terminal, type:

make


● The make command runs the makefile script. *.3pot files are built and sent to the ‘3pot’ folder.    


● Congratulations, You Made It!
