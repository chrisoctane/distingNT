=========================================
The above shows the layout of a typical text file that should accompany any .spn file before it is converted to a .3pot. 
Useful because many .spn files from the wild are either unmarked or incorrectly marked when it comes to controlling effects programs.

"\n" makes an 'Enter Key' function (new line).

Disting NT displays about 45 characters before text wraps around to the next line. I tend to max around 40-42 including "\n".
There are 10 viewable lines.
