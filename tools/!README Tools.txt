SpinCAD
=======
Fantastic bit of easy to use software that helps you create effects patches for use in systems that use the Spin FV-1 chip.  Lots of guitar pedals and Eurorack effects: Xaoc Timiszoara, Tiptop Z-DSP, Erica Dual FX & Blackhole, Nerding FX-AID, and others with lots of DIY options on top.
