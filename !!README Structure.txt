[SDCard Image]
==============================
This folder is a master copy of everything required by the module to minimise user fuss and enhance the new-user experience.  You can format your MicroSD card then copy everything here to it, exactly as it's laid out here.  If you do so, everything on your Disting NT will work out of the box (with the latest firmware).

[master] Folders
==============================
These folders are mini repositories of various types, named for the destination on the SDCard that their contents are to be placed.  

There are limits on the number of files/folders that can be used in the samples folder - 10,000 samples shared by 1000 folders, currently.  

I find it best practice to delete everything in a folder (eg. the samples folder) before copying other content into it. I'll try to make sure that these folders aren't too big to copy - but if you run into any issues, flag them in the Expert Sleepers Discord.

SDCard Image/UI scripts
==============================
2 presets with LUA UI are available in the presets folder. They have LUA UI in their name.  To try these out, load the preset then load the corresponding LUA GUI file from the 'ui_scripts folder to see some cool macro action thanks to @chordsmaze from the Expert Sleepers' Discord.

tools
==============================
All of the juicy stuff: Firmware, library tools, program building - all in one place.



If you have samples, multisamples, suggestions, complaints, or anything else to share, come to the Expert Sleepers Discord.

Have fun
