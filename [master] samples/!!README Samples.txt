First,  delete everything in the 'samples' folder on the root of the MicroSD card.
Then copy the contents of ONE of the folders here into that samples folder.

If you copy more than one folder into Disting NT's 'samples' folder,  you could end up with too many files - which can cause weird issues, currently.  The limit is 10,000 files.


By default, the instruments from 'CORec_MSCollection' populate root/samples.

Note:

The factory and forum presets that require samples will work properly once you have the factory multisamples in the 'samples' folder.   Again, just copy the contents of 'NT_factory_multisamples' into root/samples.
