First,  delete everything in the 'samples' folder (apart from 'impulses') on the root of the MicroSD card.
Then copy the contents of ONE of the folders here into that samples folder.

If you copy more than one large folder into Disting NT's 'samples' folder,  you could end up with too many files - which can cause weird issues, currently.  The limit is 10,000 files.  As of firmware 1.5, you just won't be able to load file 10,001 onwards.

Note:

The factory and forum presets that require samples will work properly once you have the factory samples in the 'samples' folder. However, the first multisample set in these alternative folders will be close enough if you don't have factory sounds installed.  I've marked them with an !exclamation.
