Factory preset, included on the MicroSD card.

## Overview
This preset turns the module into a simple USB audio interface. The 12 module inputs are routed to the host's USB inputs, while the 8 USB outputs from the host are routed to the module's 8 outputs.

## Breakdown

### USB audio (to host)
The algorithm's inputs are **Input 1** thru **Input 12**, which are sent to the host.

### USB audio (from host)
The algorithm's outputs are **Output 1** thru **Output 8**. Audio is received from the host and emerges from these 8 outputs.
