Why a version 1.1 so quickly?
=============================
 
On the V.I. Control Forum several members have tested the IRs from the first release, two weeks ago.

Someone noticed that with instruments panned to one side, the first reflections appeared on the other side... :-(

During the sweep recordings I had already noticed that I made a routing error in my MADI/Adat routing (this can be sometimes confusing stuff with so many channels). So, during the editing and processing sessions I thought I could correct this by simply swapping channels in a huge batch run. But alas, I forgot that I also needed to exchange the Left and Right files for the True Stereo sets. What a silly mistake! I am very sorry for this!

When you have downloaded this version and know friends or fellows who may still have the 1.0 version, please point them to the updated download page:

and tell them to download the version 1.1 files.
