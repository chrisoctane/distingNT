Wavetables that are used by the Wavetable VCO algorithm.

These go in 'wavetables' on the root of the MicroSD card. 
Copy the contents of one of these packs (just the .wav files) into root/wavetables.

One exception here is that the factory banks are in a different format. Here, each folder is equivalent to one .wav file of the other packs.  In this case, copy all contents of 'NTfactory_wavetables' to root/wavetables.
