.3pot files are the patches, or 'programs' used by Disting NT's three_pot algorithm.

Sourcing and rebuilding these was a big community effort and everyone deserves a pat on the back.

Personally, I'll take cash :)

Drag the 'three_pot' folder into 'programs' on the root of the MicroSD.  If the 'programs' folder doesn't exist yet, create it  (all lower-case).
